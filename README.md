This model will be deployed to our Jetson-based edge inference systems for job sites allowing us to monitor and report on unsafe conditions surrounding excavation and earth moving. This model should run on a single-board computer; we will likely combine functionality with the PPE model to determine if somebody is wearing a harness near an unsafe excavation.
